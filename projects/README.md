# Projects Directory

This directory contains project-specific files and resources.

## Organization

Each project should have its own subdirectory with a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project overview and documentation
├── src/               # Source files (if applicable)
├── docs/              # Project-specific documentation
├── data/              # Project-specific data
└── assets/            # Images, media, and other assets
```

## Creating a New Project

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name (use lowercase with hyphens)
2. Add a README.md file explaining the project
3. Organize project files in appropriate subdirectories
4. Keep the project self-contained

## Project Guidelines

- Each project should be self-explanatory
- Include clear documentation
- Keep files organized within the project directory
- Use relative paths within the project

## Examples

Project directories might include:
- `website-redesign/` - Files for a website redesign project
- `data-analysis-2025/` - Data analysis project files
- `automation-scripts/` - Collection of automation scripts
