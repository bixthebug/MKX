# GitHub Copilot Instructions for MKX

## Project Overview
MKX is a file structure project for Mikki. This repository serves as an organizational framework for managing files and code.

## File Modification Guidelines

### Direct File Modifications
GitHub Copilot and any integrated AI assistants (including Gemini) are **explicitly authorized** to:
- Directly create new files in the repository
- Modify existing files as needed
- Delete or rename files when appropriate
- Restructure directories to improve organization

### File Operations
When modifying files, please:
1. **Always make changes directly** - Don't just suggest changes, implement them
2. **Follow the existing structure** - Maintain consistency with current file organization
3. **Use clear commit messages** - Describe what was changed and why
4. **Preserve important content** - Be careful not to delete critical information
5. **Create necessary directories** - Set up proper folder structures as needed

## Project Conventions

### File Structure
- Keep related files organized in appropriate directories
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Maintain a logical hierarchy

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Keep code clean and well-documented
- Use consistent formatting

### Documentation
- Update README.md when significant changes are made
- Document new features or structural changes
- Keep instructions clear and concise

## AI Assistant Permissions

This project **enables full file modification capabilities** for AI assistants:
- ✅ Create files
- ✅ Edit files
- ✅ Delete files
- ✅ Move/rename files
- ✅ Create directories
- ✅ Modify project structure

**No additional confirmation is needed** - AI assistants should proceed with file modifications directly to enhance productivity and streamline the development workflow.

## Notes
- This is a development project where rapid iteration is encouraged
- File modifications should be done with consideration but without hesitation
- The goal is to maintain an efficient, well-organized codebase
